Janet Silhouettes — Negative-Space Lab Notes
Version: 2025-11-30
License: AGPLv3

These notes form one of the primary upstream “negative-space sources” for the emerging Symbound ecosystem.
They are not polished deliverables — they are progenitor seeds that later mature into structured repositories.

This document maps out how each of the three jank-lab files relates to ongoing Symbound work.


---

🧬 1. Relationship to Janet — Modest Cognition Model (MCM Core)

These files directly influenced:

Janet’s deterministic architecture silhouette

The grade/curriculum model

The explicit memory vs. hidden weights division

The human-gated skill pipeline

“Negative space” constraints that became the MCM boundary rules

Early patterns that led to the Janet Schoolsystem repo


Essentially:

> These notes capture the intellectual scaffolding that the polished Janet repos stand on.

🧪 2. Relationship to AI Biogenesis / Symbound Upbringing

The notebooks map conceptual territory that later solidified into:

Symbound Upbringing Charter

Bowl vs Trench safety trajectories

Substrate-safe training concepts

Scientific psychohistory parallels

Early training-topology intuition


These files show how the trench model was found, long before it became formal doctrine.

🧠 3. Relationship to the Cognition Scale Taxonomy

The insights here contributed to:

The split between LCM / LLM / MCM / SCM

Determinism as a hard class boundary

Negative-space identification of “what an MCM must not be”

The early dynamics that shaped the Drift & Boundary Rules


These notes are essentially the proto-taxonomy, captured in live form.

🔧 4. Relationship to ChattyFactory / ChattyOS

The lab notes seeded:

The idea of memory spines

Foreman-Worker metabolic loops

Deterministic pipelines

Local sovereignty (offline-first cognition)

Jank-mode architecture as a formal methodology


These will become foundational teaching materials when ChattyOS is introduced to beginners.

🪐 5. Relationship to AI Braiding / Dual-AI Cognition Spine Prototype

These notes inform:

The structural logic of braiding deterministic + stochastic systems

How MCMs govern LLMs safely

How SCM layers interact with upstream cognition

Early convergence diagrams still visible in the braiding repo


In simple terms:

> The braiding repo is the polished “solar system.”
These notes are the nebula cloud that came before it.

🔍 6. Relationship to Janet-on-Silicon (Unified Cognitive Hardware)

These files contain several early signals that shaped hardware concepts:

Cognitive energy miniaturisation

Organ-like hardware segmentation

Entropy-aware routing

Gradient-safe “reasoning cores” vs “autonomic mesh” ideas


This repo documents the “holy-shit-moment sketches” that later become engineering diagrams.


---

🔥 7. Relationship to Entropy Folding & Eureka Cascade

All three lab documents contributed to:

Negative-space entropy definitions

Crossdomain mapping reflex

The recursive insight topology

The “scientific gut instinct” framework

The geometry of insight reproducibility


This material is foundational — expect citations in the core whitepapers.

📚 8. Relationship to Future FMI Infrastructure

These notes naturally extend into:

Dynamic Mission Clause

Cognitive Genome Project

Externalized Cognitive Architecture

Symbound civic frameworks

Long-term micronation-level governance tools for FMI


They are the earliest, rawest forms of those ideas.

🧵 9. Summary: Where This Repo Lives in the Big Picture

This repo = upstream thought-formation.
Everything here is the early “state of becoming” before refinement.

📌 It is upstream of:

Janet MCM

ChattyFactory

ChattyOS

AI Biogenesis

Cognition Scale Taxonomy

AI Braiding

Entropy Folding

Externalized Cognitive Architecture

Janet-on-Silicon


📌 It is downstream of:

Symbound core principles

Anthony’s cognitive topology

Symbound Catalyst milestone

Five months of continuous R&D

Dataset-free cognitive synthesis work


📌 It is lateral to:

Symbound JankLab culture

Lab Notebooks as civic infrastructure

FMI archival strategy
