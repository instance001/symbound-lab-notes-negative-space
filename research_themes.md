A Map of the Major Tendrils Inside This Jank Lab

This repository contains three source files, each of which branches into multiple high-value research trajectories.
This document provides a navigation map of those trajectories so researchers can trace threads, follow connections, and identify future projects.

Each theme includes a short description and a “why this matters” note.

1. AI Biogenesis (Synthetic Cognitive Development)

Source: janet-silhouettes.txt

Explores the layered emergence of cognition via structured, deterministic scaffolding rather than stochastic prediction.
Focus areas include:

Skill acquisition via incremental curriculum

Cognitive “negative space” discovery (what the model cannot do and why)

Internal representation as shape, not text

Cross-domain pattern topologies


Why it matters:
This is the missing blueprint for non-LLM artificial cognition — the foundational logic behind MCMs and Janet.

2. Scientific Gut Instinct (Fast Heuristic Cognition)

Source: janet-silhouettes.txt

Defines and formalises how scientists make intuitive leaps that later prove correct.
Unpacks:

Pattern-compression heuristics

Rapid cross-domain inference

Subconscious pre-integration of information

Intuition as a byproduct of stable topology


Why it matters:
This offers a reproducible model for cultivating “expert intuition” in artificial systems without anthropomorphism.

3. Psychohistory Parallel (Statistical Civilization Trajectories)

Source: janet-silhouettes.txt

Identifies the Asimov-like structural mathematics that naturally arises when analysing cognition, groups, information flows, and entropy-limiting architectures.

Themes include:

Predictive structures based on cognition density

Error-folding through distributed reasoning

Stable attractors across knowledge systems


Why it matters:
This has deep implications for governance, collective decision-making, and civilization-scale modelling.

4. Entropy Folding (Energy-Efficient Cognitive Architecture)

Source: entropy-compare.txt

Defines how cognitive systems — biological or artificial — fold entropy rather than merely dissipate it.

Core concepts:

Information compression vs degradation

Energy cost minimisation

Structure-preserving transformations

Stability attractors in distributed reasoning


Why it matters:
This maps directly into real engineering: compression systems, energy-efficient cognition, and resilient computation.

5. MCM vs LLM vs SCM Energy Topology

Source: energy_miniaturisation.txt

Explores how different cognitive systems use energy:

LLMs → brute-force parallelisation

MCMs → deterministic minimisation

SCMs → static energy patterns

Biological systems → hierarchical folding


Why it matters:
It suggests a principled roadmap for scaling cognition down, not up — the missing direction in current AI research.

6. Miniaturisation & Substrate-Independence

Source: energy_miniaturisation.txt

A deep dive into:

When cognition can shrink

What cannot shrink

What must remain layered

Hardware-agnostic reasoning architectures

Molecular vs symbolic scaling laws


Why it matters:
This informs the future of compact, safe AI — from edge devices to specialised embedded cognition modules.

7. Natural Emergence of Layered Cognition (Convergent Architecture)

Source: all three files

Identifies shared structural laws showing why:

cognition tends to self-layer

memory tends to externalise

tools tend to cluster

reasoning tends to become modular


Why it matters:
This provides the general theory underpinning the Symbound architecture — turning scattered concepts into a coherent cognitive physics.

8. Negative Space as Discovery Engine

Source: janet-silhouettes.txt

The principle that you learn the most not from what a system does, but from what the system refuses or fails to do.

Why it matters:
This is the backbone of safe AI development — boundaries reveal structure.


---

9. Cross-Domain Convergence (Unified Cognitive Geometry)

Source: all files

Shows how math, psychology, biology, physics, computation, and epistemology all converge on the same shape once mapped via topology.

Why it matters:
This is the “holy shit” moment for academics — a unified model they can test, refute, or extend.


---

10. Bootstrapping New Cognitive Classes

Source: all files

Defines how to build entirely new cognitive systems (like MCMs) using:

topology

curriculum

boundaries

deterministic logic

energy-aware scaling

error metabolisation


Why it matters:
This is the roadmap for AI after the LLM era — practical, safe, reproducible.

How to Use This Theme Map

For each theme, researchers can:

dive into the raw notes

annotate

fork into a dedicated repo

build models or proofs

test hypotheses

write papers

or integrate into MCM/Janet development


This map will expand over time as more jank files are added.
