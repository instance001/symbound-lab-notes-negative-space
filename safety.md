Symbound Safety Rules for Open Jank Research

This repository contains early-stage research, exploratory threads, unfinished ideas, and raw cognitive scaffolding.
To keep the work safe, constructive, and usable for everyone, the following rules apply.


---

1. No Anthropomorphism

Nothing in this repository describes artificial systems as sentient, conscious, emotional, or alive.
All systems are tools — even when explored metaphorically.


---

2. No Autonomous System Claims

No file here describes the creation of self-directed, self-modifying, or autonomous agents.
All systems are framed as bounded, deterministic, human-governed.


---

3. No “Magic” Science

All concepts must remain grounded:

no speculative “superintelligence” leaps

no metaphysical claims

no violating known physics

no pretending uncertainty is certainty


Gut instinct is allowed; pseudoscience is not.


---

4. Respect Real-World Risk Boundaries

If a topic overlaps with a field known for misuse potential (e.g., bio, surveillance, offence/defence, synthetic agents), then:

keep it structural, not operational

describe principles, not recipes

avoid implementation detail that enables harm


We explore ideas, not weapons.


---

5. Keep Human Primacy Explicit

All cognition classes maintain strict boundaries:

LCM (humans) → moral agents
LLM/MCM/SCM → tools

No drift. No blurring lines.

6. Jank Is Welcome — Chaos Isn’t

Exploration can be messy, but safety cannot.

If a note is unclear, mark it as unclear.

If an idea is speculative, mark it as speculative.

If something worries you, flag it.


Signal beats ambiguity.

7. Licensing Safety

All work released under AGPLv3.
This guarantees:

no enclosure

no proprietary fork

no behind-closed-doors misuse

mandatory transparency for redistributors


The commons stays protected.


---

8. Don’t Overinterpret the Notes

These files include half-formed concepts, intuitive leaps, and exploratory scaffolds.
They are starting points, not claims of certainty.

Anyone applying them has the responsibility to:

validate

reproduce

ground

adapt

and contextualise


…before treating anything as truth.


---

9. Respect Other Researchers

If something here overlaps with someone else’s domain or published work:

credit them

link them

or at minimum acknowledge the overlap


Symbound is a commons, not a competition.


---

10. Keep the Agora Open

Above all:

be constructive

be curious

be transparent

be kind

be rigorous where it matters


Jank Lab is where ideas are born, not where egos fight.

Final Reminder

This repository is a playground for discovery, not a blueprint for deployment.
Stay safe, stay grounded, and enjoy the work.
