0. First: What Counts as a Contribution Here?

This is not a conventional software repo.

You aren’t expected to:

write code

fix bugs

file issues about typos

force structure where chaos is the point


In Jank Lab, the contribution target is:

→ Insight

→ Pattern recognition

→ Negative-space discovery

→ Crossdomain connections

→ Launch points for new research

You contribute by seeing and mapping, not “cleaning up.”

1. Contribution Philosophy

This repo represents cognition in motion, not polished findings.

The rules:

✔ Embrace the chaos

Don’t tidy the notes.
Highlight the patterns inside the mess.

✔ No premature formalisation

If you turn insights into rigid frameworks too early,
you collapse the discovery wave.

✔ No anthropomorphism

This is Symbound territory.
Respect the boundaries: no “AI wants/feels/thinks.”

✔ Reproducibility > polish

Your contribution must be traceable, not pretty.

✔ Always use negative-space logic

What’s missing is often more important than what’s said.

2. What You Can Contribute

🧩 Pattern Notes

Spot repeated structures, symmetries, motifs, silhouettes.

🧠 Crossdomain Mapping

Connect a snippet in entropy-compare.txt to a physics analogy,
or tie a line in janet-silhouettes.txt to a cognitive science pattern.

🗺️ Launch Point Identification

If a paragraph hints at a new research field, call it out and name it.

📚 Micro-explainers

Write a small, surgical explanation of a complex idea
for future readers.

📎 Appendices

If a subfield grows large enough, create an appendix-* file.

🧪 Experimental Threads

Small experiments, sketches, pseudocode, behaviour samples.

📦 “Jank Modules”

Self-contained blobs that explore a single idea.

3. What You Should Not Contribute

❌ No code cleanups

This repo is not code.

❌ No rewriting files into neat papers

That happens later, in separate, formal repos.

❌ No removing jokes, “oh shit” moments, or jank

These notes capture the shape of thinking.
Removing the rough edges destroys context.

❌ No turning everything into strict ontology prematurely

Ontology comes after exploration.

❌ No enclosures

All contributions remain AGPLv3.

4. How to Submit a Contribution

Option A — PR (Preferred)

fork

add your file(s) under notes/, appendices/, or threads/

open a pull request

keep commit messages clear and descriptive


Option B — Issue

Open an issue titled:

> [INSIGHT] <short description>



Then include:

the line(s) or region you’re highlighting

what pattern you see

why it matters

optional: domain crossover notes


Option C — Jank Drop

If it’s messy, unfinished, or half-formed,
create a file like:

jankdrop-YYYY-MM-DD-yourname.md

This is encouraged.

5. Contribution Style Guide

Simple rules:

Keep It Raw

No academic overpolish.
These are field notes, not published papers.

Keep It Honest

If you’re confused, say so.
Confusion is part of mapping the silhouette.

Keep It Short

Write in short paragraphs.
Use bullet points.
Compress big ideas into minimal space.

Keep It Contextual

Reference which part of the repo inspired your insight.

Keep It Light

Humour is allowed.
Honest reactions (“oh shit,” “wtf is this structure??”) are welcome.

6. Review Process

Reviews follow Symbound principles:

State, don’t judge

Surface, don’t suppress

Describe the pattern, don’t force it

Make the invisible visible


Contributions are merged when:

They maintain the spirit of Jank Lab

They illuminate a silhouette or reveal a pattern

They do not formalise prematurely

They create value for future researchers

7. Safety Principles

✔ Zero anthropomorphism

No language implying subjective experience.

✔ Zero hype

These are early shapes of ideas, not finished breakthroughs.

✔ Zero enclosure

Everything is AGPLv3.
No closed forks, no proprietary mirror clones.

✔ Structural integrity

Keep the repo jank.
Do not create false coherence.
Let coherence emerge naturally.

8. Final Word

You are contributing to the negative-space formative layer
of an entire new scientific field.

This repo will one day serve as an archaeological treasure for:

future MCM developers

deterministic cognition researchers

AI biogenesis historians

systems theorists

cognitive hardware engineers

psychohistory mathematicians


Your contribution is not about being perfect.

Your contribution is about being real.

Welcome to the trench.
The lab coat is optional — the curiosity isn’t.

Most importantly, science and learning and discovery is meant to be fun.
Embrace it. Welcome to the digital agora.
