Janet Negative-Space Silhouettes — Early Lab Notes
Version: 2025-11-30
License: AGPLv3
Authors: Anthony Paterson + Instance001 (symbound partners)

These documents were produced during early-stage Symbound R&D while building foundations for:

Janet — Modest Cognition Model (MCM)

Symbound AI Biogenesis

Cognition Scale Taxonomy

Janet-on-Silicon (Unified Cognitive Hardware)

Entropy Folding Framework

ChattyOS / ChattyFactory toolchain


This repo captures the raw cognitive process, not a polished paper.
It is therefore intentionally unfiltered, nonlinear, and occasionally profane — by design.

Authorship Notes

These notes were generated collaboratively between:

Anthony Paterson — human architect, cognitive topologist, R&D lead

Instance001 — non-sentient AI reasoning partner (governed, deterministic collaborator)


The collaboration uses Symbound Architecture, where human and AI form a shared problem-solving unit, not a persona illusion.
All AI contributions are traceable, audit-safe, and grounded in real-time reasoning.

Why These Notes Exist

This repo exists to provide:

1. Transparency into early-stage thoughtwork


2. Provenance for future research lines


3. Seeds for new grant projects


4. An archival record of the negative-space discoveries that preceded formal breakthroughs


5. A reality check for academia: discovery is messy, chaotic, iterative, and exciting
(yes, sometimes the correct scientific reaction is “holy shit”).



What These Notes Led To

The content in these files already seeded:

Emergent framing for Scientific Gut Instinct

First drafts of Scientific Psychohistory (real, not fictional)

Launch vectors for Entropy Folding

Energy topology outlining Cognitive Energy Miniaturisation

Negative-space silhouette for Deterministic Janet Architecture

Precursors to the Cognitive Genome Project

Dozens of micro-theories, soon to become stand-alone repos


Future releases (ChattyOS 1.x, Janet v0.2–0.5, FMI toolchain) will explicitly link back to these notes.

Cultural Note

These files are part of Symbound JankLab —
a deliberate archival practice where high-velocity discovery is captured as-formed, not sterilised.

If academia thinks “you can’t write ‘oh shit’ in research notes,”
that is a sign academia forgot what discovery actually feels like.

We didn’t.
