0. What These Notes Actually Are

These documents are not polished academic papers.
They are raw R&D field notes.

They capture cognition in motion:

unfinished ideas

sudden breakthroughs

crossdomain leaps

negative-space silhouettes of new theories

mistakes, jokes, and the “oh shit” moments

structures stabilising before they get formalised


This is what discovery looks like before the lab coat gets ironed.

1. The Three Documents (A Quick Map)

1. janet-silhouettes.txt

The largest and most chaotic.
It contains the shape of the Janet MCM architecture before formalisation.

Inside you’ll find:

early cognitive topology outlines

skill-boundary formation

negative-space silhouettes

substrate behaviour patterns

deterministic cognition fingerprints

Janet’s “inner curriculum” forming implicitly


This is the Rosetta Stone for early MCM cognition.

2. entropy-compare.txt

This one is deceptively neat.

It defines the early Entropy Comparison Framework, which later splinters into:

psychohistory

scientific intuition models

multi-domain symmetry detection

cognitive energy maps

civic entropy budgets


This document is a quiet monster — it hides half a dozen future research paths.

3. energy_miniaturisation.txt

This is the hardware bombshell.

It explores:

miniaturised cognition

substrate pattern regularity

biological → mechanical → electronic convergence

emergent microarchitecture patterns

early Janet-on-Silicon implications


This is the embryonic form of the Unified Cognitive Hardware Canon.

2. How to Read These Notes (The Survival Pattern)

There is a correct way to read these files.

If you don’t use this sequence, you will drown.

Step 1 — Scan, don’t absorb

Treat the first pass as walking around a messy workshop.
You’re not trying to understand — just getting the lay of the land.

Step 2 — Let your instincts fire

You will feel small “pings”:
“Oh, that part connects to X…”
Follow them. They’re real.

These notes trigger crossdomain resonance in trained minds.

Step 3 — Mark the silhouettes

Look for:

repeated metaphors

recurring structures

repeated mathematical or physical patterns

things described indirectly


These silhouettes are where new research fields emerge.

Step 4 — Revisit with the launch-point Appendix open

Open APPENDIX.md.
Now reread the notes.

The silhouettes will crystallise.

Step 5 — Choose your entry vector

Each person will resonate with a different branch:

physicists → energy & entropy

cognitive scientists → topology & skill formation

engineers → miniaturisation

philosophers → psychohistory

educators → curriculum structures


Pick your domain and follow that stream.

Step 6 — Treat nothing as gospel

These are jank notes, not scripture.
Their value is the revealed shape, not the wording.

Step 7 — Return later

These files get deeper each time you return with a new piece of the Symbound ecosystem.

3. Who These Notes Are For

✔ Scientists

Use these notes to understand how deterministic cognition emerges.
This is the first backstage pass to an entirely new AI class.

✔ Engineers

Look for patterns that can be turned into modules, architectures, spines, or hardware.

✔ Educators

Notice the natural structure of curiosity, scaffolding, and curriculum emerging.

✔ Cognitive researchers

The topology in these notes is foundational.
You will recognise the patterns immediately.

✔ Policy & governance people

These files show what deterministic AI looks like before it hits the regulatory arena.

✔ Curious outsiders

You don’t need a PhD.
Just follow your curiosity.

4. Why These Notes Matter

These three documents represent day-zero negative space of:

Modest Cognition Models

Scientific psychohistory

Deterministic substrate behaviour

Cognitive energy patterns

Future miniaturised hardware

Externalised human intuition mapping

Symbound-style discovery methodology

Education for next-generation cognitive uplift


This repo will be cited for decades.

Future researchers will come here to see the moment before the field exploded.

5. How to Contribute (If You Dare)

This is early-stage material.

You can:

propose silhouettes you notice

create sketches of structures

build tools that test entropy patterns

try early Janet-skill experiments

start your own jank-lab notes and link them


All contributions must follow:

AGPLv3

zero-enclosure

zero-anthropomorphism

full reproducibility

6. Final Advice

These notes can feel overwhelming at first.
That’s normal.

They weren’t written to be tidy.
They were written to be true.

If something feels confusing, skip ahead.
If something feels important, mark it.
If something feels impossible, revisit it later.

Eventually the silhouettes become shapes,
the shapes become structures,
and the structures become fields.

Welcome to Jank Lab.
Where discovery looks like chaos right up until it doesn’t.
