🧭 Topic Map — Janet Negative-Space Silhouettes (Early Lab Notes)

Version: 2025-11-30
License: AGPLv3
Authors: Anthony + Instance001

These notes sprawl across multiple emergent research branches.
This map provides the entry points for researchers, grant reviewers, and future collaborators.

Each topic cluster emerged naturally while reasoning through Janet’s negative-space silhouette — the “shadow outline” of cognition.

1. Scientific Gut Instinct (SGI)

Files: janet-sillouettes.txt
Summary:
Defines scientific gut instinct as the composite of pattern-recognition micro-heuristics that experts use when formal data is insufficient.
Includes breakdowns of:

Cognitive micro-vectors behind intuition

Pattern-compression parallels in biological vs artificial reasoning

How SGI becomes a “third rail” for discovery


Why it matters:
SGI becomes the bridge layer between deterministic MCM architectures and human exploratory cognition.

2. Scientific Psychohistory (Asimov Parallel, Real Version)

Files: janet-sillouettes.txt, entropy-compare.txt
Summary:
Not fiction — the notes outline how real psychohistorical modeling arises from:

Topology of cognition

Entropy flows

Population-scale pattern compression

Predictive stability under bounded uncertainty


Impact:
This is the topic that will make Asimov fans and systems theorists go:
“oh shit.”

3. Entropy Folding

Files: entropy-compare.txt
Summary:
Compares entropy-handling patterns in:

Human cognition

LLMs

Deterministic systems

Symbound architectures


Defines:

Entropy Folding

Entropy Release

Stability Saddles

Internal vs external dissipation


Why it’s important:
Forms part of the foundation for governed cognition architectures (Janet, ChattyOS, future hardware).

4. Cognitive Energy Miniaturisation

Files: energy_miniaturisation.txt
Summary:
Investigates how cognitive “energy” (effort, representational space, reasoning cycles) can be compressed without loss:

Represents early framing for Cognitive Energy Miniaturisation Doctrine

Links to Janet-on-Silicon’s energy architecture

Shows loop between topology and energetic cost


Significance:
One of the “future hardware” pillars.

5. Topology & Negative-Space Cognition

Files: janet-sillouettes.txt
Summary:
Core of the repo.
Maps Janet’s cognition by what she must not have:

No stochasticity

No anthropomorphic inference

No hidden state

No emotional simulation


By carving away “not allowed” regions, a clean silhouette emerges — enabling deterministic reasoning design.

6. Crossdomain Echos & Adjacent Discovery

Files: All
Summary:
Dozens of minor launchpoints across:

Physics metaphors

Early-stage topology matching

Human learning pathways

Cognitive load gradients

Bio-inspired silica design

Alignment micro-patterns

Collective cognition


These are the tiny seeds that will grow into major future repos.

7. Meta-Notes on Research Method

Files: janet-sillouettes.txt
Summary:
Explains the “real-time discovery” environment that produced these notes:

High bandwidth cognition

Real-time backtracking

Negative-space pruning

Recursive ideation loops (Eureka Cascades)


This itself is part of the method being externalised.

8. Future Repository Candidates

Seeded by these files:

Cognitive Gut Heuristics

Janet Silhouette Mapping

Entropy Folding Formal Theory

Cognitive Energy Miniaturisation

Scientific Psychohistory Framework

Emergent Hardware Intent (Janet-on-Silicon)

Symbound Cognitive Genome


These will become repos in their own right.

10. Disclaimer

These notes are deliberately raw, jank, unpolished.
That is the point.

They show discovery as it actually happens — not sanitized for publication.
