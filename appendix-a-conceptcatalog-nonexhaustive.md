Appendix A — Concept Catalogue (Open, Expanding, Non-Exhaustive)

Key ideas, metaphors, phenomena, and proto-theories touched on or implied within the lab notes.

This list is intentionally incomplete and unordered.
Its purpose is to provide anchor points, not directions.
Readers are encouraged to:

find their own expansions

challenge connections

discover missing intermediaries

propose additional concepts

explore unexpected cross-domain collisions


This is not a roadmap.
This is a constellation map.
